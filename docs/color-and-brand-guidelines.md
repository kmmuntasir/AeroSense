# Brand & UI Guidelines

**Product:** [App Name] Weather App MVP

---

## 1. Brand Personality & Vibe

*   **Clear & Uncluttered:** The user should feel a sense of calm and clarity, even if the weather is chaotic.
*   **Modern & Trustworthy:** Clean lines, ample whitespace, and data presented with authority.
*   **Actionable & Friendly:** The tone of the "Meaningful Insights" should be helpful and direct, like a knowledgeable friend (e.g., "Grab an umbrella, rain starting soon.").

## 2. Color Palette

The app should heavily rely on a clean base, allowing semantic weather colors to pop and draw the eye instantly. Both Light and Dark modes are highly recommended for weather apps.

### Core Colors
*   **Background (Light Mode):** Crisp Off-White (e.g., `#F8F9FA`) to reduce eye strain compared to pure white.
*   **Background (Dark Mode):** Deep Slate or Charcoal (e.g., `#121212` or `#1E2124`) — avoiding pure black for depth.
*   **Primary Accent:** "Sky Indigo" (e.g., `#4A90E2`) — used for primary buttons, active states, and brand trust.

### Semantic Weather Colors (Data Visualization)
These colors are crucial for instantly conveying temperature and conditions without reading.

*   **Hot / High UV:** Vibrant Orange or Warm Coral.
*   **Cold / Freezing:** Ice Blue or Cyan.
*   **Rain / Water:** Deep Teal or Aquamarine.
*   **Warnings / Alerts (If used):** Soft Crimson.

## 3. Typography

The most critical aspect of the app is legibility. Numbers (temperatures) and short text blocks must be readable at a glance, potentially while the user is walking or outside in bright sunlight.

*   **Primary Typeface:** A highly legible, modern geometric sans-serif.
    *   *Recommendations:* Inter, SF Pro (iOS native), Roboto (Android native), or Plus Jakarta Sans.
*   **Hierarchy:**
    *   **Current Temperature:** Massive, bold, perhaps using a condensed weight to save horizontal space (e.g., 96dp size).
    *   **Insights Text:** Medium weight, highly readable, distinct from secondary data.
    *   **Secondary Data (Time, low/highs):** Lighter weight, subdued color (gray) so it doesn't compete with the primary temperature.
*   **Tabular Figures:** Ensure the chosen font supports tabular numbers so timelines and 7-day lists align perfectly vertically.

## 4. Shape & Iconography

*   **Iconography Style:** Solid, rounded, or thick-line icons. Avoid overly complex or hyper-realistic weather illustrations for the MVP to maintain fast load times and a modern look.
*   **Shapes:** Use rounded corners (e.g., 12px or 16px border radius) for cards, search bars, and forecast modules to make the interface feel approachable and modern.
